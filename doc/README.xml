The XML input handler is homegrown and very basic at this point.  The 
following represents valid XML input:

<AsteriskManagerInput>
   <Action Value="Ping"/>
   <ActionID Value="foo"/>
</AsteriskManagerInput>

<AsteriskManagerInput>
   <ProxyAction Value="SetOutputFormat"/>
   <Outputformat Value="CSV"/>
</AsteriskManagerInput>

It's entirely possible that other formats will break the parser entirely.  
I am toying with going with a lightweight XML parser like MiniXML that may 
give some more flexibility at the price of having a dependency.  It is 
very likely, though, that the current parser will work fine for most 
applications.
